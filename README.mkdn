Welcome to TipsyOs
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with TipsyOs M, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the TipsyOs trees, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/TipsyOs/platform_manifest.git -b 6.0



Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync

Next step is going to the fridge for beer, and go from there
